abstract = {Fully automated driving can potentially provide enormous benefits to society. However, it has been unclear whether people will appreciate such far-reaching technology. This study investigated anonymous textual comments regarding fully automated driving, based on data extracted from three online surveys with 8,862 respondents from 112 countries. Initial filtering of comments with fewer than 15 characters resulted in 1,952 comments. The sample consisted primarily of males (74{\%}) and had a mean age of 32.6 years. Next, we launched a crowdsourcing job and asked 69 workers to assign each of the 1,952 comments to at least one of 12 predefined categories, which included positive and negative attitude to automated driving, enjoyment in manual driving, concerns about trust, reliability of software, and readiness of road infrastructure. 46{\%} of the comments were classified into the category 'no meaningful information about automated driving', leaving 792 comments for further analysis. 39{\%} of the comments were classified as 'positive attitude towards automated driving' and 23{\%} were classified as 'negative attitude towards automated driving'. In conclusion, the public opinion appears to be split, with a substantial number of respondents being positive and a significant number of respondents being negative towards fully automated driving.},

abstract = {Battery operated electric vehicles offer the opportunity to manage zero-emission car traffic at low operational costs. Due to their current range constraints, electric vehicle operations are mainly attractive for inner-city transport, with taxicabs being one possible field of application. In this paper, a battery operated electric taxicab fleet is simulated in a small city scenario using the agent-based transport simulation MATSim. The simulation results indicate no negative impact on the level of service provided by taxis in everyday operations when using electric cars. However, facing increased demand, conventionally operated taxi fleets may provide a better service. The simulation also demonstrates that every taxi rank only needs to be equipped with a small number of charging outlets. Under these circumstances, it may be useful from the passengers' perspective to dispatch those taxis with the highest battery charge level first.},

The multi- agent transport model MATSim is presented in detail and some possible research questions on autonomous vehicles – the future car fleet size, future demand patterns, and the interaction between public transport and autonomous vehicles – are introduced. Reason is given, why agent-based models are particularly suited to investigate these questions. I.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AV) promise many benefits for future mobility. One of them is a reduction of the required total vehicle fleet size, especially if AVs are used predominantly as shared vehicles. This paper presents an investigation of this reduction potential using a simulation approach. Fleets of shared AVs, which serve predefined demands, are simulated with the simulation framework presented in the paper. Different demand scenarios are used, which represent different shares of a spatially and temporally detailed representation of the car travel demand of the greater Zurich region, Switzerland. These demand scenarios are combined with different supply scenarios assuming different AV fleet sizes. It is found that for a given fleet performance target (here 95{\%} of all transport requests are served within 5 minutes) the relationship between served demand and required fleet size is non-linear and the ratio decreases as the demand increases. So there is, as could be expected, a scale effect, which has the important implication that for different levels of demand the fleet is used more or less efficiently. This paper also finds that, if waiting times of up to 10 minutes are accepted, a reduction of up to 90{\%} of the total vehicle fleet can be possible even without active fleet management like vehicle redistribution. Such effects require however, that a large enough share of the car demand can be served by AVs.},

abstract = {A number of companies including Google and BMW are currently working on the development of autonomous cars. But if fully autonomous cars are going to drive on our roads, it must be decided who is to be held responsible in case of accidents. This involves not only legal questions, but also moral ones. The first question discussed is whether we should try to design the tort liability for car manufacturers in a way that will help along the development and improvement of autonomous vehicles. In particular, Patrick Lin's concern that any security gain derived from the introduction of autonomous cars would constitute a trade-off in human lives will be addressed. The second question is whether it would be morally permissible to impose liability on the user based on a duty to pay attention to the road and traffic and to intervene when necessary to avoid accidents. Doubts about the moral legitimacy of such a scheme are based on the notion that it is a form of defamation if a person is held to blame for causing the death of another by his inattention if he never had a real chance to intervene. Therefore, the legitimacy of such an approach would depend on the user having an actual chance to do so. The last option discussed in this paper is a system in which a person using an autonomous vehicle has no duty (and possibly no way) of interfering, but is still held (financially, not criminally) responsible for possible accidents. Two ways of doing so are discussed, but only one is judged morally feasible.},

By means of a 63-question Internet-based survey, we collected 5000 responses from 109 countries (40 countries with at least 25 respondents). We determined cross-national differences, and assessed correlations with personal variables, such as age, gender, and personality traits as measured with a short version of the Big Five Inventory. Results showed that respondents, on average, found manual driving the most enjoyable mode of driving. Responses were diverse: 22{\%} of the respondents did not want to pay more than {\$}0 for a fully automated driving system, whereas 5{\%} indicated they would be willing to pay more than {\$}30,000, and 33{\%} indicated that fully automated driving would be highly enjoyable. 69{\%} of respondents estimated that fully automated driving will reach a 50{\%} market share between now and 2050. Respondents were found to be most concerned about software hacking/misuse, and were also concerned about legal issues and safety. Respondents scoring higher on neuroticism were slightly less comfortable about data transmitting, whereas respondents scoring higher on agreeableness were slightly more comfortable with this. Respondents from more developed countries (in terms of lower accident statistics, higher education, and higher income) were less comfortable with their vehicle transmitting data, with cross-national correlations between ?? = -0.80 and ?? = -0.90. The present results indicate the major areas of promise and concern among the international public, and could be useful for vehicle developers and other stakeholders.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Systems that enable high levels of vehicle-automation are now beginning to enter the commercial marketplace. Road vehicles capable of operating independently of real-time human control under an increasing set of circumstances will likely become more widely available in the near future. Such vehicles are expected to bring a variety of benefits. Two such anticipated advantages (relative to human-driver vehicle control) are said to be increased road network capacity and the freeing up of the driver-occupant's time to engage in their choice of leisurely or economically-productive (non-driving) tasks.In this study we investigate the implications for intersection capacity and level-of-service of providing occupants of automated (without real-time human control), autonomously-operating (without vehicle-to-X communication) cars with ride quality that is equivalent (in terms of maximum rates of longitudinal and lateral acceleration) to two types of rail systems: [urban] light rail transit and [inter-urban] high-speed rail. The literature suggests that car passengers start experiencing discomfort at lower rates of acceleration than car drivers; it is therefore plausible that occupants of an autonomously-operating vehicle may wish to instruct their vehicle to maneuver in a way that provides them greater ride comfort than if the vehicle-control algorithm simply mimicked human-driving-operation.On the basis of traffic microsimulation analysis, we found that restricting the dynamics of autonomous cars to the acceleration/deceleration characteristics of both rail systems leads to reductions in a signalized intersection's vehicle-processing capacity and increases in delay. The impacts were found to be larger when constraining the autonomous cars' dynamics to the more-restrictive acceleration/deceleration profile of high-speed rail. The scenarios we analyzed must be viewed as boundary conditions, because autonomous cars' dynamics were by definition never allowed to exceed the acceleration/deceleration constraints of the rail systems. Appropriate evidence regarding motorists' preferences does not exist at present; establishing these preferences is an important item for the future research agenda.This paper concludes with a brief discussion of research needs to advance this line of inquiry.},

The audience for game theory has grown dramatically in recent years, and now spans disciplines as diverse as political science, biology, psychology, economics, linguistics, sociology, and computer science, among others. What has been missing is a relatively short introduction to the field covering the common basis that anyone with a professional interest in game theory is likely to require. Such a text would minimize notation, ruthlessly focus on essentials, and yet not sacrifice rigor. This Synthesis Lecture aims to fill this gap by providing a concise and accessible introduction to the field. It covers the main classes of games, their representations, and the main concepts used to analyze them."This introduction is just what a growing multidisciplinary audience needs: it is concise, authoritative, up to date, and clear on the important conceptual issues." -Robert Stalnaker, MIT, Linguistics and Phil...},

It discusses autonomous vehicle benefits and costs, predicts their likely development and implementation based on experience with previous vehicle technologies, and explores how they will affect planning decisions such as optimal road, parking and public transit supply. The analysis indicates that some benefits, such as independent mobility for affluent non-drivers, may begin in the 2020s or 2030s, but most impacts, including reduced traffic and parking congestion (and therefore road and parking facility supply requirements), independent mobility for low-income people (and therefore reduced need to subsidize transit), increased safety, energy conservation and pollution reductions, will only be significant when autonomous vehicles become common and affordable, probably in the 2040s to 2060s, and some benefits may require prohibiting human-driven vehicles on certain roadways, which could take longer.},

abstract = {Choice models are today ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the 'right' model of choice to use. Since models of choice are inherently high dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a-priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially sub-optimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and over/under-fitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a 'generic' model of consumer choice (namely, dis-tributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a non-parametric approach in which the data automatically selects the 'right' choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major US automaker, our method demonstrates a 20{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the art benchmark models, which can result in a 10{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step towards 'automating' the crucial task of choice model selection.},

abstract = {This report documents a new study of public opinion about self-driving vehicles in China, India, and Japan. The survey yielded completed responses from 610 respondents in China, 527 respondents in India, and 585 respondents in Japan. For comparison, the report also includes recently released findings from the same survey in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia. The main findings (applicable to each of the six countries) are as follows: ? The majority of respondents had previously heard of autonomous or self-driving vehicles, had a positive initial opinion of the technology (or neutral in the case of Japan), and had high expectations about the benefits of the technology. ? However, the majority of respondents expressed high levels of concern about riding in self- driving vehicles, safety issues related to equipment or system failure, and self-driving vehicles not performing as well as human drivers. ? Respondents also expressed high levels of concern about vehicles without driver controls; self- driving vehicles moving while unoccupied; and self-driving commercial vehicles, buses, and taxis. ? The majority of respondents expressed a desire to have this technology in their vehicles. However, a majority was also unwilling to pay extra for the technology (except for respondents in China and India). In comparison to the respondents in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia, respondents in China and India had more positive initial opinions of self-driving vehicles, expressed greater interest in having such technology on their personal vehicles, and were willing to pay the most for it. Japanese respondents, on the other hand, generally had more neutral initial opinions about self-driving technology and were willing to pay the least for it. The main implications of these results are that the respondents in the six countries surveyed, while expressing high levels of concern about riding in vehicles equipped with this technology, mostly feel positive about self-driving vehicles, have optimistic expectations of the benefits, and generally desire self-driving-vehicle technology (though a majority in four out of the six countries surveyed are not willing to pay extra for such technology at this time).},

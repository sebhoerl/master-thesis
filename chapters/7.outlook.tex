\section{Outlook}
\label{sec:outlook}

During the course of this thesis a versatile and extentable basis model for the
simulation of autonomous vehicles has been developed. Many topics in the field
which would be interesting to investigate were not part of the scope of this thesis.
The following sections will present the most important and interesting ones and
give directions on how to simulate them with the framework. Likewise, these sections
also give an overview about critical points, which are not taken into account in
the previous results, but could change the overall picture significantly.

Four different aspects will be put into focus:

\begin{itemize}
\item Extensions of the infrastructure
in the model, which would account for what needs to be done to maintain the AV
service in a more realistic and/or efficient way,
\item the interaction with the AV service, widening the possibilities that one
or multiple agents have to take advantage of the new travel mode, and
\item extensions to the current demand simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Infrastructure Extensions}

Since autonomous vehicles in general will take great advantage of the ongoing
electrification in the automotive industry, the availability of the respective
infrastructure is one factor which can determine how fast the adaptation of AVs
will progress \citep{Burmeister2016}.
Given the right amount of resources to create such an infrastructure, a big question
that arises is how many recharging facilities are needed and where they should begin
located in order to serve certain sizes of AV fleets \citep{Chen2015}. Furthermore, how can a combined
infrastructure for ordinary owned EVs, private AVs and publicly provided AV services
be designed?

As a first step one could assume that AVs recharge at dropoff locations, where they
are artificially put to rest for a certain minimum idle time in order to simulate
the recharging process. This would already lead to results on the customer acceptance
side, but would ignore effects on congestion if AVs would actually need to take long
trips to the next charging facility. Previous studies using MATSim already gave interesting results on the implementation
of eletrified taxis in Berlin with distributed charging facilities
over the network \citep{Bischoff2014}. Such research could be combined with the AV framework developed here.
The modular AgentFSM component would make it easy to add specific new points in the
state chains of an AV to drive to a charging facility. Then again, the simulation framework could be used to get insights in which scheduling
strategies would be optimal for an AV fleet if recharging has to be taken into account.

Another idea to improve the simulation is to introduce means of simulating maintenance
and parking. So far it has been assumed that autonomous vehicles will reside where the last
dropoff has taken place. This assumption, especially in heavily packed cities, is
quite optimistic, since parking space might be rare. In consequence, the driven
kilometers per AV in the unoccupied state could be quite off the actual distance.
More mileage would be needed to find a parking space in between tasks.
This rises a whole range of questions on how an optimal AV scheduling would
look like, maybe depending on the demand level, it might be even interesting to
run  studies on whether the search for parking space might be inferior
to roaming around.

This could be done in combination with intelligent repositioning, where in between peak
hours taxis could be intelligently moved to likely pickup positions and thus minimize the waiting
time for customers, increasing the acceptance and reducing
operator costs at the same time because less unoccupied miles might be travelled.

With the parallelization of customer trips the presented framework already shows
by example how such an algorithm could be incorporated into the existing infrastructure
without having too much impact on the computation times. In general, doing ``some''
intelligent repositioning should always be more beneficial than doing none. In
this regard, the repositioning could be computed in parallel to the ongoing
traffic simulation, while still offering the ability to restrict it if it slows
down the main loop of MATSim.

\subsection{Usage and interaction with the AV service}

The AV service in the developed model so far is very basic in the way customers
are able to interact with it. One obvious advantage of AV fleets is, that up to five people could be transported
in ordinarily shaped cars and even more in autonomous minibusses or full-sized busses.
Intelligent routing and scheduling algorithms would make it possible to pick up passengers
at arbitrary locations, not being bound to a fixed public transport schedule.

Due to the extensible structrue of the AV extension, it would be easy to
add such behaviour in principle. However, the problem of optimizing the trips of
more than one passenger, probably while already on a ride, is a highly complex
problem and acceptable heuristics are still an important research subject.
Adding such functionality to the AV framework would make it possible to test such
strategies in near-realistic scenarios and measure the performance of different
heuristics.

Additionally, autonomous vehicles are likely to relax the last mile problem, where people are not
motivated to opt for public transport, because the last mile from the transport
facility to their home is too long. An AV could bridge this distance, maybe being
prescheduled to pick up the passenger according to the current expected arrival
times.

Implementing this behaviour would need only small changes in the MATSim framework.
Generally, a public transport trip is generated as three legs: One \texttt{transit\_walk}
leg in order to get to the stop facility, one \texttt{pt} leg for the actual residual
time in the bus  and another \texttt{transit\_walk}. A first attempt
would be to replace some of the \texttt{transit\_walk} legs during the planning
phase with \texttt{av} trips, which could already lead to a convincing simulation
of AVs feeding the public transport network.
A probable requirement for this to work well would be to have prescheduled AVs
to give a higher reliability on these connections.

Prescheduled autonomous vehicles would be easy to implement in the existing infrastructure.
In fact, test have already been done, but abandoned due to the fact that in a first
approximation delays from the scheduling can be modeled using worse utility values
for the waiting times.
In the current state, the AV framework fully supports such prescheduled trips, though
their impact has not been investigated in the scope of this thesis. As shown in
figure \cref{fig:avstates}, where the state diagram of the AV is depicted, a ``Waiting''
state is already included, which would make an AV which arrives early at a pickup
location wait for the passenger.

\subsection{Demand Analysis}

An intereting point in the simulation is the spatial dependence. On one side,
it would be interesting to investigate where AV users live, maybe indicating that
on specific pricing strategies, people from the suburbs prefer AVs, while other
strategies might encourage people living in the center to use them.

Heavily related to that is the initial distribution of AVs at the beginning
of the daily simulation. As described before, AVs are currently distributed dependent on
the population density, though that might not be the best approach. Especially
if one wants to encourage suburbians to use AVs, the density there should be higher.

In that regard it would be beneficial to investigate how the initial conditions
in the MATSim simulation influence the result on an abstract level. For the case of
AVs, having initial AV plans mainly assigned to agents from a city center, but not for people
from the suburbs, the relaxed state might settle down in exactly this condition.
However, if AVs are mainly distributed in the suburbs in the initial plans, the
main user group might stay there, just because during the simulations the waiting
times are shorter in either case and therefore these people might stick to their
initial plan decisions. Therefore, a thorough investigation of the distribution
behavior of the algorithm would be very interesting.

Furthermore, the research in this thesis has shown that without any incentives, AVs might lead
to adverse effects, which should be corrected by intelligent policy decisions. \Citet{Chen16} suggests
interesting approaches of incentivizing AV usage. In order to ``free'' the city center
from too much congestion one could for instance in the Sioux Falls scenario put high monetary fees on using the streets within the
highway belt for private cars, while in parallel increasing the likelihood for AVs
to use the highways. This way one could try to move traffic to the highways, then
taking a direct trip to the workplaces in a perpendicular way.

Experiments like these are ready to be done with the existing simulation framework
by adding custom scoring functions for private cars and autonomous vehicles.

Finally, efforts have been made recently to diversify the population in MATSim simulations \citep{Chakirov2015}.
This means that people might be constrained or inclined due to age or income to use certain means
of transport. Combining the simulation of AVs with the introduction of that heterogeneity
could give insights on how the availability and pricing of AVs affect the distribution
of users in terms of a richer set of social variables.

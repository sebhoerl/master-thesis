\section{The Sioux Falls Scenario}
\label{sec:sioux}

The Sioux Falls scenario for MATSim \citep{Chakirov2014} is a fictitious city
with dynamic travel demand, create for the purpose of testing extensions to the
MATSim framework in a realistic (i.e. using all the functionality of MATSim) setting
while still providing reasonable computation times due to its rather compact size
compared to real world scenarios. The model has been used in this testing for the
purpose of testing the implementations and the basic functionality of the model
for autonomous vehicles.
